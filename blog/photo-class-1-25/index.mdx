Different kind of post, I took a photography class to this winter and had a really great experience with it. 
Had an opportunity to learn more classical photography concepts and techniques and experienced a variety of cool phto styles and subjects from my classmates while also sharing my own work.


Put this photo package together for my final project. This was my first time with my new camera and my strobe and I am really happy with the results. Lighting has often been more difficult here than in other parts of the world, but with this setup I feel I was able to get better detail than I ever have before.
